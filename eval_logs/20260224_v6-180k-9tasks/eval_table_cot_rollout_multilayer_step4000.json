The distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and the collecting duct are key areas for sodium, potassium, and hydrogen ion regulation. Also, the principal c",

Let's break down what each place offers. \n\nStarting with A) good mood. That's not a physical place. A good mood is an emotional state, so you can't really get an outfit or makeup there. So probably not A.\n\nB) Greek tragedy. That's a type of play or ",
