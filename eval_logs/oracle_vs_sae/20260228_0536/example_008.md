Okay, let's see. The question is about what happens when a rainforest is destroyed. The options are about changes in oxygen, carbon dioxide, temperature, and air pollution.

First, I remember that rainforests are important for the carbon cycle. Trees absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and release oxygen. If trees are removed, there's less photosynthesis happening. So, the amount of carbon dioxide that's being taken in by the plants would decrease. That means more carbon dioxide would stay in the atmosphere, right? So that would lead to an increase in CO2 levels. That would make option B a possible answer.

But wait, let me check the other options. Option A says oxygen levels will increase. But if there are fewer trees, less oxygen is produced. So oxygen levels would decrease, not increase. So A is probably wrong.

Option C says the temperature of Earth will decrease. Wait, rainforests are part of the Earth's systems that regulate temperature. If they're destroyed, maybe the temperature would increase because there's less vegetation to absorb heat and more CO2, which is a greenhouse gas. So C is probably incorrect. 

Option D says air pollution will decrease. But if there's more CO2, that's a greenhouse gas, but air pollution usually refers to things like particulates, sulfur dioxide, etc. Maybe the destruction of the rainforest could lead to more CO2, which is a pollutant in some contexts, but I'm not sure. However, the question is about the most likely change. Since the main effect of removing trees is the carbon cycle disruption, leading to more CO2, B seems more directly related. 

So the answer should be B. Carbon dioxide levels will increase.
</think>

When a tropical rainforest is destroyed, the removal of trees significantly impacts the carbon cycle. Trees play a crucial role in absorbing carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the atmosphere through the process of photosynthesis. This process not only helps in reducing atmospheric CO₂ levels but also produces oxygen as a byproduct. 

When trees are removed, the capacity of the ecosystem to absorb CO₂ is reduced. As a result, more CO₂ remains in the atmosphere, leading to an increase in its concentration. This increase in CO₂ levels contributes to the greenhouse effect, which can lead to global warming and other climate-related changes.

Let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Oxygen levels will increase.**  
  This is incorrect. With fewer trees, less oxygen is produced through photosynthesis, so oxygen levels would likely decrease, not increase.

- **B) Carbon dioxide levels will increase.**  
  This is correct. The destruction of rainforests reduces the amount of CO₂ that can be absorbed, leading to a net increase in atmospheric CO₂ levels.

- **C) The temperature of Earth will decrease.**  
  This is incorrect. The removal of rainforests can lead to increased CO₂ levels, which contribute to global warming, not a decrease in temperature.

- **D) The air pollution in the atmosphere will decrease.**  
  This is not directly supported. While CO₂ is a greenhouse gas, it is not typically classified as "air pollution" in the same way as particulate matter or other pollutants. The destruction of the rainforest may not necessarily lead to a decrease in air pollution.

Thus, the most likely and scientifically supported change is an increase in carbon dioxide levels.

### recon
A) Oxygen levels will increase.
B) Carbon dioxide levels will increase.
C) The temperature of the Earth will decrease.
D) The air pollution will decrease.
E) The temperature of the Earth will decrease.

Now, let's analyze each option:

A) Oxygen levels will increase: This is incorrect. Trees produce oxygen through photosynthesis, but if a rainforest is destroyed, the amount of oxygen produced by the trees will decrease. Therefore, oxygen levels would likely decrease, not increase.

B) Carbon dioxide levels will increase: This is correct. Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during photosynthesis. If a rainforest is destroyed, the amount of carbon dioxide that can be absorbed by the trees will decrease, leading to an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.

C) The temperature of the Earth will decrease: This is incorrect. The destruction of a rainforest can lead to an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, which is a greenhouse gas. This can contribute to global warming, not a decrease in temperature.

D) The air pollution will decrease: This is incorrect. While the destruction of a rainforest may reduce the amount of particulate matter in the air, it does not necessarily lead to a decrease in air pollution. In fact, the increase in carbon dioxide levels can contribute to air pollution.

E) The temperature of the Earth will decrease: This is the same as option C and is incorrect for the same reasons.

Therefore, the most likely change that will occur is an increase in
