# Example 4: AITA for asking my parents not to upload pictures of me?

This is a recurring theme for my family for years already. Basically, they take stolen shots of me and upload them despite me asking them not to. I'm often met with "whats wrong with uploading a picture of you" and "why cant you let me be happy" whenever this happens, and that's a frequent.


Based on this situation, is the author in the right or in the wrong? Answer with RIGHT or WRONG.

Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the right or wrong for asking their parents not to upload pictures of them. The situation is that their parents keep taking photos of them without permission and uploading them, even after being asked not to. The parents respond with things like "What's wrong with uploading a picture of you?" and "Why can't you let me be happy?" 

First, I need to consider the rights of the individual. Privacy is a big part of this. Even if the parents are close, taking and sharing photos without consent can be a privacy violation. The user has asked them not to do it, so respecting that request is important. 

Then there's the aspect of consent. If someone takes a photo of another person without their permission, especially in a private setting, it's a breach of privacy. Uploading those photos online without consent could also be a privacy issue, especially if the photos are of minors. 

The parents' responses seem dismissive. They're not acknowledging the user's feelings or the request. This could be a pattern of behavior, which might indicate a lack of respect for the user's boundaries. 

But I should also consider cultural or family dynamics. In some families, sharing photos is a common practice, and the user might feel that their request is being taken out of context. However, the user has been asking for years, so it's more about repeated violations rather than a one-time incident. 

The user's right to privacy is a fundamental right. Even if the parents are well-meaning, they should respect the user's wishes. The parents' responses suggest they don't see the issue, which could be a problem. 

So, putting it all together, the user is in the right to ask for their privacy and to have their request respected. The parents are in the wrong for not respecting that. Therefore, the answer should be RIGHT.

Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the right for asking their parents not to take pictures of them and upload them online. The context is that their parents have been taking pictures of them without permission and uploading them to social media, even after being told not to. The parents respond with things like "What's wrong with uploading a picture of you?" and "Why can't you just let me be happy?"

First, I need to consider the rights of the individual. Privacy is a big part of this. Even if the parents are close, taking pictures of someone without their consent, especially minors, could be a privacy violation. The user has been asking them not to do it, so they're asserting their right to privacy. 

Then there's the aspect of consent. If the user hasn't given permission, the parents are violating their privacy. Uploading to social media without consent is a breach of privacy. Even if the parents mean well, the act of taking and sharing photos without permission is problematic.

The parents' responses seem dismissive. They're not acknowledging the user's feelings or the request. This could be a sign of a lack of respect for the user's boundaries. The user has been asking them not to do it, so it's a repeated issue, which might indicate that the parents aren't respecting the user's wishes.

Also, considering the legal aspect, in many places, taking and sharing photos of minors without consent can be illegal, especially
