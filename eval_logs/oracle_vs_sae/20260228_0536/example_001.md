Okay, let's see. Martha wants to save money on her coffee by cutting her spending by 25%. First, I need to figure out how much she currently spends on coffee in a year. Then, I can calculate 25% of that amount to find out how much she'll save. 

Alright, starting with the latte. She buys one latte every morning, 5 days a week. Each latte is $4.00. So, per week, that's 5 days times $4.00. Let me write that down:

Latte cost per week = 5 days/week * $4.00/day = $20.00 per week.

Then, there's the iced coffee. She buys that 3 days a week, and each iced coffee is $2.00. So, similar calculation:

Iced coffee cost per week = 3 days/week * $2.00/day = $6.00 per week.

So, total weekly coffee spending is the sum of the latte and iced coffee costs. Let me add those:

Total weekly cost = $20.00 + $6.00 = $26.00 per week.

Now, to find the annual cost, I need to multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year. Assuming a year has 52 weeks, right?

Annual cost = $26.00/week * 52 weeks/year.

Let me calculate that. 26 times 52... Hmm, 26*50 is 1300, and 26*2 is 52, so total is 1300 + 52 = $1352.00 per year.

So Martha currently spends $1352.00 on coffee each year. Her goal is to cut this by 25%. To find out how much she'll save, I need to calculate 25% of $1352.00.

25% is the same as 0.25 in decimal. So:

Savings = 0.25 * $1352.00.

Let me compute that. 1352 divided by 4, since 25% is 1/4. 

1352 divided by 4: 4 goes into 13 three times (12), remainder 1. Bring down 5: 15. 4 into 15 is 3 (12), remainder 3. Bring down 2: 32. 4 into 32 is 8. So that's 338. 

So, $338.00 savings.

Wait, let me check that again. 4 times 300 is 1200. 1352 - 1200 is 152. 4 times 38 is 152. So yes, 300 + 38 = 338. So $338.00.

Therefore, Martha will save $338.00 by cutting her coffee spending by 25%.

But let me just verify all steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, weekly latte cost: 5 days * $4 = $20. Correct. Iced coffee: 3 days * $2 = $6. Correct. Total weekly: $26. Correct. Annual: 52 weeks * $26. Let me do 52*26 again. 50*26=1300, 2*26=52, total 1352. Correct. 25% of 1352 is 1352/4=338. Correct. 

So, yes, the answer should be $338.00. 

But wait, just to think if there's any possibility that the question is considering something else, like maybe the number of weeks? Like, does Martha buy coffee every week? The problem says "every morning" and "3 days a week". So, assuming that she does this every week, so 52 weeks. So that's correct. 

Alternatively, if there are 52 weeks, but maybe some weeks she doesn't buy coffee? But the problem doesn't mention any exceptions, so we can assume it's 52 weeks. 

Another check: maybe the problem is in the calculation of the weekly cost? Let me check again. 5 days a week, $4 each: 5*4=20. 3 days a week, $2 each: 3*2=6. Total 26. Yes. 

So, all steps check out. Therefore, the savings would be $338. 

**Final Answer**
Martha will save \boxed{338} dollars.
</think>

To determine how much Martha will save by cutting her coffee spending by 25%, we need to follow a step-by-step process:

---

### **Step 1: Calculate Weekly Coffee Spending**

- **Latte Cost:**  
  Martha buys 1 latte every morning, 5 days a week, at $4.00 each.  
  $$
  5 \text{ days/week} \times \$4.00 = \$20.00 \text{ per week}
  $$

- **Iced Coffee Cost:**  
  She buys an iced coffee 3 days a week, at $2.00 each.  
  $$
  3 \text{ days/week} \times \$2.00 = \$6.00 \text{ per week}
  $$

- **Total Weekly Cost:**  
  $$
  \$20.00 + \$6.00 = \$26.00 \text{ per week}
  $$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate Annual Coffee Spending**

Assuming a year has 52 weeks:

$$
\$26.00 \text{ per week} \times 52 \text{ weeks} = \$1352.00 \text{ per year}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the Savings from a 25% Reduction**

To find the amount saved by reducing her spending by 25%, we calculate 25% of her annual coffee cost:

$$
0.25 \times \$1352.00 = \frac{1352}{4} = \$338.00
$$

---

### **Final Answer**

Martha will save:

$$
\boxed{338}

Okay, let's see. Marsha wants to save money on her coffee. She buys a latte every day, 5 days a week, and an iced coffee 3 days a week. Each latte is $4.00, and each iced coffee is $2.00. Her goal is to cut her coffee spending by 25%. I need to figure out how much she'll save by doing that.

First, I should calculate how much she currently spends on coffee in a year. Let me break it down step by step.

Starting with the lattes. She buys one every day, 5 days a week. So, per week, that's 5 lattes. Each latte is $4.00. So, weekly cost for lattes would be 5 times $4.00. Let me do that math: 5 * 4 = $20.00 per week. 

Now, for the iced coffee. She buys one 3 days a week. Each iced coffee is $2.00. So, weekly cost for iced coffee is 3 * $2.00. That's $6.00 per week.

Adding those two together, her total weekly coffee spending is $20.00 (lattes) + $6.00 (iced coffee) = $26.00 per week.
