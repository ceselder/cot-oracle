Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is about Erich Fromm's views on how society affects our ability to realize our true nature, which he describes as being loving, creative, and productive. The options are different responses to societal demands, and we need to pick which one allows a person to realize that true nature.

First, I need to recall what Fromm said. Fromm was a psychologist and social theorist who wrote about the concept of "social character." He discussed different personality types that people develop in response to societal pressures. He identified several modes of adaptation to society, such as the authoritarian, the exploitative, the receptive, etc. 

Fromm's main idea was that modern society, especially capitalist societies, can stifle individuality and prevent people from expressing their true selves. He believed that people might adopt certain behaviors or attitudes to fit into society, which can prevent them from being truly loving, creative, and productive. 

He also talked about the concept of "productive" and "creative" individuals. Fromm argued that the productive person is one who is creative and can contribute to society in a positive way, as opposed to being driven by destructive or exploitative tendencies. 

Now, looking at the options, the question is asking which response to societal demands allows a person to realize their true nature. The options are A to J, each with a different response. 

Fromm's theory includes different modes of adaptation. Let me try to remember which ones he mentioned. He discussed the authoritarian, the exploitative, the receptive, the manipulative, the marketing, the hoarding, the submissive, the controlling, etc. 

Wait, Fromm's main types are the authoritarian, the exploitative, the receptive, and the productive. Wait, maybe I need to check. Fromm's concept of the "modes of existence" includes the productive, the receptive, the exploitative, the authoritarian, the marketing, the hoarding, the manipulative, the submissive, and the controlling. 

But the key point here is that Fromm believed that the productive mode is the one that allows for the realization of one's true nature. The productive person is creative, loving, and productive. The other modes, like the exploitative or the authoritarian, are more about conforming to societal demands in a way that suppresses individuality. 

So, if the question is asking which response allows a person to realize their true nature, the answer would be the productive mode. Let me check the options again. 

Looking at the options, option B says "The productive allows a person to realize its true nature..." So that would be B. 

But wait, let me make sure. Fromm's theory is that the productive person is the one who is creative and can contribute to society in a positive way, which aligns with the idea of being loving, creative, and productive. The other options like exploitative, manipulative, etc., are more about negative responses that prevent the individual from being true to themselves. 

So the correct answer should be B. But let me check if there's any other possible answer. For example, the receptive mode. Fromm also talked about the receptive mode, which is about being open to others and not being dominated by society. But I think the productive mode is more directly related to being creative and productive. 

Alternatively, maybe the receptive is the one that allows for true nature. Wait, Fromm's concept of the productive person is someone who is creative and can produce, which is the opposite of the exploitative or the authoritarian. 

So, the answer is B. The productive allows a person to realize their true nature. Therefore, the correct answer should be B.
</think>

Erich Fromm, a prominent psychologist and social theorist, emphasized the tension between individuality and societal pressures. He argued that modern society often suppresses the natural human tendencies toward love, creativity, and productivity, which he considered essential to realizing one's true nature. In his work, Fromm identified various modes of adaptation to societal demands, each reflecting different psychological responses to social pressures.

Among these, the **productive mode** stands out as the one that aligns most closely with the realization of one's authentic self. The productive individual is characterized by creativity, initiative, and a capacity to contribute positively to society. This mode represents a harmonious relationship with the world, where the individual is not merely reacting to external demands but is instead expressing their inner potential in a constructive and meaningful way.

Other modes, such as the **exploitative**, **authoritarian**, or **manipulative**, reflect responses that prioritize conformity, control, or self-interest, often at the expense of personal authenticity and creativity. These modes, according to Fromm, hinder the individual's ability to express their true nature.

Thus, the only response that allows a person to realize their true nature—being loving, creative, and productive—is the **productive** mode.

Okay, so I need to figure out this question about Erich Fromm's theory on how society affects our ability to realize our true nature. The question is asking which response to society allows a person to realize their true nature as being loving, creative, and productive. The options are different responses to society, and I have to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that Erich Fromm was a psychologist and social theorist who wrote about the concept of "social character." He talked about how people adapt to society in different ways, which can affect their personality and behavior. He identified several types of social characters, like the authoritarian, the exploitative, the receptive, etc. 

Fromm's main idea was that society can stifle individuality and prevent people from being their true selves. He believed that people have a natural tendency to be loving, creative, and productive, but societal structures can hinder that. He also talked about the "productive mode" of adaptation, which is the one that allows individuals to realize their potential. 

Wait, let me think. Fromm's theory includes different modes of adaptation. The productive mode is when individuals are creative and productive, contributing to society in a positive way. The other modes, like the authoritarian or the exploitative, are more about conforming to societal pressures in ways that might suppress individuality. 

So the question is asking which response to society allows a person to realize their true nature. The options are A to J. The
