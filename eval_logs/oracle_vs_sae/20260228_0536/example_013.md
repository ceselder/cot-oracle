Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a 50 mole % solution of propyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol. They're being distilled to the boiling point of 90°C. The vapor pressure of the condensate collected is 1066 mm Hg at that temperature. The vapor pressures of pure ethyl and propyl alcohols at 90°C are given as 1190 and 574 mm Hg respectively. We need to find three things: a) the mole fraction of ethyl alcohol in the boiling liquid, b) the mole fraction of ethyl alcohol in the distillate, and c) the number of moles of ethyl alcohol that were distilled. The options are given from A to J, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let me recall some concepts. Since the problem mentions ideal behavior, I can use Raoult's Law for the vapor pressures. Raoult's Law states that the partial pressure of each component in the vapor phase is equal to the mole fraction of that component in the liquid phase multiplied by its vapor pressure when pure. So, for a binary mixture, the total vapor pressure would be the sum of the partial pressures of each component.

But wait, the problem says that the solution is distilled to the boiling point of 90°C. So, the boiling point of the solution is 90°C. However, the boiling point of a solution is determined by the vapor pressure of the solution. When a solution boils, its vapor pressure equals the atmospheric pressure. But here, the vapor pressure of the condensate is given as 1066 mm Hg. Wait, maybe I need to clarify.

Wait, the problem says that the vapor pressure of the condensate collected in a cooled receiver is 1066 mm Hg at that temperature. Hmm. So, when the solution is boiling at 90°C, the vapor pressure of the solution is equal to the atmospheric pressure. But if the condensate is collected in a cooled receiver, maybe that's the vapor pressure of the distillate? Or is the condensate's vapor pressure the same as the vapor pressure of the distillate?

Wait, maybe I need to think about the distillation process. When you distill a solution, the vapor that forms above the liquid has a certain composition, which is determined by the vapor pressures of the components. Then, this vapor is condensed and collected. The vapor pressure of the condensate would be the same as the vapor pressure of the vapor that was collected, right? But the problem states that the vapor pressure of the condensate is 1066 mm Hg at 90°C. Wait, but the condensate is a liquid, so its vapor pressure would be the same as the vapor pressure of the liquid at that temperature. But if the condensate is collected in a cooled receiver, maybe the temperature is lower? Wait, the problem says "the vapor pressure of the condensate collected in a cooled receiver is 1066 mm Hg at that temperature." So, the temperature is 90°C, and the vapor pressure of the condensate (which is the liquid) is 1066 mm Hg. Wait, but that seems confusing. Wait, maybe the condensate is the vapor that is collected, and its vapor pressure is 1066 mm Hg? Or is the condensate's vapor pressure the same as the vapor pressure of the vapor?

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the vapor pressure of the distillate (the vapor) as 1066 mm Hg. But the temperature is 90°C. So, if the distillate is collected in a cooled receiver, then the temperature of the receiver is lower, but the problem says "at that temperature," which is 90°C. Maybe the condensate is at 90°C, so the vapor pressure of the condensate (which is a liquid) is 1066 mm Hg. But that would mean that the vapor pressure of the liquid is 1066 mm Hg. However, the boiling point of the solution is 90°C, so the vapor pressure of the solution at 90°C is equal to the atmospheric pressure. Wait, but the problem says that the vapor pressure of the condensate is 1066 mm Hg. Maybe the atmospheric pressure is 1066 mm Hg? So, the boiling point of the solution is 90°C, which means that the vapor pressure of the solution is equal to the atmospheric pressure. Therefore, the vapor pressure of the solution is 1066 mm Hg. Therefore, the total vapor pressure of the solution is 1066 mm Hg. So, that would be the sum of the partial pressures of the two components.

So, let me try to formalize this. Let me denote:

Let’s assume that the solution is boiling at 90°C, so the vapor pressure of the solution is equal to the atmospheric pressure. However, the problem says that the vapor pressure of the condensate is 1066 mm Hg at that temperature. Wait, maybe the condensate is the vapor that is collected, so the vapor pressure of the vapor is 1066 mm Hg. But if the vapor is collected in a cooled receiver, then the temperature of the receiver is lower, but the problem says "at that temperature," which is 90°C. So, maybe the vapor pressure of the vapor is 1066 mm Hg at 90°C. Therefore, the total vapor pressure of the solution is 1066 mm Hg. Therefore, the total vapor pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of the two components.

So, for part a), we need to find the mole fraction of ethyl alcohol in the boiling liquid. Let me denote:

Let’s let x be the mole fraction of ethyl alcohol in the liquid. Then, the mole fraction of propyl alcohol is 1 - x. Since the solution is 50 mole %, wait, wait, hold on. Wait, the initial solution is 50 mole % of propyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol. Wait, but the question is about the boiling liquid. Wait, is the boiling liquid the same as the initial solution? Or is it after some distillation?

Wait, the problem says "a 50 mole % solution of propyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol is distilled to the boiling point of 90°C." So, the solution is being distilled until it reaches the boiling point of 90°C. Wait, but the boiling point of a solution is determined by its vapor pressure. So, if the solution is boiling at 90°C, that means that the vapor pressure of the solution is equal to the atmospheric pressure. However, the problem says that the vapor pressure of the condensate is 1066 mm Hg at that temperature. So, maybe the atmospheric pressure is 1066 mm Hg? Therefore, the vapor pressure of the solution is 1066 mm Hg. Therefore, the total vapor pressure of the solution is 1066 mm Hg. Therefore, using Raoult's Law, the total vapor pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of each component.

So, the partial pressure of ethyl alcohol is x * P_ethyl, and the partial pressure of propyl alcohol is (1 - x) * P_propyl. Therefore, total vapor pressure P_total = x * P_ethyl + (1 - x) * P_propyl = 1066 mm Hg.

But wait, the initial solution is 50 mole %, so does that mean that the initial mole fraction is 0.5 for each? But the question is about the boiling liquid. Wait, but if the solution is being distilled, then the composition of the boiling liquid might change. Wait, but the problem says "distilled to the boiling point of 90°C." So, perhaps the boiling point of the solution is 90°C, which is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the solution equals the atmospheric pressure. Therefore, the vapor pressure of the solution is 1066 mm Hg. Therefore, we can use that to find the mole fraction of ethyl alcohol in the boiling liquid.

Wait, but the initial solution is 50 mole %, but if we are distilling it, the composition of the boiling liquid might not be 50 mole % anymore. Wait, but the problem says "a 50 mole % solution... is distilled to the boiling point of 90°C." So, maybe the boiling point of the solution is 90°C, which is achieved by distilling it. Therefore, the solution is boiling at 90°C, so the vapor pressure of the solution is equal to the atmospheric pressure. Therefore, the vapor pressure of the solution is 1066 mm Hg. Therefore, we can use Raoult's Law to find the mole fraction of ethyl alcohol in the boiling liquid.

Wait, but the problem says that the vapor pressure of the condensate is 1066 mm Hg. Wait, maybe the condensate is the vapor that is collected, so the vapor pressure of the vapor is 1066 mm Hg. But if the vapor is collected in a cooled receiver, then the temperature of the receiver is lower, but the problem says "at that temperature," which is 90°C. Therefore, the vapor pressure of the vapor is 1066 mm Hg at 90°C. Therefore, the total vapor pressure of the solution is 1066 mm Hg. Therefore, the total vapor pressure is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the components.

So, let me write that equation:

P_total = x * P_ethyl + (1 - x) * P_propyl = 1066 mm Hg

Where x is the mole fraction of ethyl alcohol in the liquid. The vapor pressures of pure ethyl and propyl alcohols are given as 1190 and 574 mm Hg at 90°C. Therefore:

x * 1190 + (1 - x) * 574 = 1066

Let me solve this equation for x.

Expanding the equation:

1190x + 574 - 574x = 1066

Combine like terms:

(1190 - 574)x + 574 = 1066

Calculate 1190 - 574:

1190 - 574 = 616

So:

616x + 574 = 1066

Subtract 574 from both sides:

616x = 1066 - 574 = 492

Therefore:

x = 492 / 616 ≈ 0.8

Wait, 492 divided by 616. Let me compute that. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 4: 492/4 = 123, 616/4 = 154. So 123/154 ≈ 0.7987. So approximately 0.8. So x ≈ 0.8. Therefore, the mole fraction of ethyl alcohol in the boiling liquid is approximately 0.8. But looking at the options, none of them have 0.8 as option a). Wait, the options for a) are 0.60, 0.45, 0.40, 0.25, 0.35, 0.30, 0.10, 0.55, 0.20, 0.50. Wait, none of them are 0.8. Wait, that can't be. Did I do something wrong here?

Wait, hold on. Let me check my calculations again. Maybe I made a mistake in the equation.

The problem says that the vapor pressure of the condensate is 1066 mm Hg at 90°C. Wait, maybe the condensate is the vapor, so the vapor pressure of the vapor is 1066 mm Hg. But if the vapor is collected in a cooled receiver, then the temperature of the receiver is lower, but the problem says "at that temperature," which is 90°C. Therefore, the vapor pressure of the vapor is 1066 mm Hg at 90°C. Therefore, the total vapor pressure of the solution is 1066 mm Hg. Therefore, the equation is correct. So, solving gives x ≈ 0.8. But none of the options have that. Wait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again.

Wait, the problem says "a 50 mole % solution of propyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol is distilled to the boiling point of 90°C." So, the initial solution is 50 mole %, but after distilling, the boiling point is 90°C. Wait, but the boiling point of a solution depends on its composition. So, if the solution is being distilled, the composition of the boiling liquid might change. However, the problem says that the boiling point is 90°C. So, perhaps the boiling point of the solution is 90°C, which is achieved by distilling. Therefore, the vapor pressure of the solution is equal to the atmospheric pressure. But the problem says that the vapor pressure of the condensate is 1066 mm Hg. Wait, maybe the atmospheric pressure is 1066 mm Hg? Therefore, the vapor pressure of the solution is 1066 mm Hg. Therefore, the equation is correct. But solving gives x ≈ 0.8, which is not in the options. Therefore, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me check the numbers again. The vapor pressure of pure ethyl alcohol is 1190 mm Hg, and propyl alcohol is 574 mm Hg. The total vapor pressure of the solution is 1066 mm Hg. So, the equation is:

x * 1190 + (1 - x) * 574 = 1066

Let me compute 1190x + 574 - 574x = 1066

So, 616x + 574 = 1066

Then, 616x = 1066 - 574 = 492

x = 492 / 616 ≈ 0.8. Let me compute 492 divided by 616:

Divide numerator and denominator by 4: 123 / 154 ≈ 0.7987. So approximately 0.8. So, that's 0.8. But none of the options have that. Wait, maybe the question is not about the vapor pressure of the solution, but about the vapor pressure of the distillate?

Wait, the problem says "the vapor pressure of the condensate collected in a cooled receiver is 1066 mm Hg at that temperature." So, the condensate is the liquid that is collected. So, the vapor pressure of the condensate (which is a liquid) is 1066 mm Hg at 90°C. Wait, but the vapor pressure of a liquid is a property of the liquid. So, if the condensate is a liquid, then its vapor pressure is 1066 mm Hg at 90°C. But that would mean that the condensate is a mixture of the two alcohols, and its vapor pressure is 1066 mm Hg. But how does that relate to the boiling liquid?

Wait, maybe the condensate is the vapor that is collected, so the vapor pressure of the vapor is 1066 mm Hg. But if the vapor is collected in a cooled receiver, then the temperature of the receiver is lower, but the problem says "at that temperature," which is 90°C. Therefore, the vapor pressure of the vapor is 1066 mm Hg at 90°C. Therefore, the total vapor pressure of the solution is 1066 mm Hg. Therefore, the equation is correct. But the answer is not in the options. Therefore, maybe I have misunderstood the question.

Wait, let me check the options again. The options for part a) are:

A) 0.60

B) 0.45

C) 0.40

D) 0.25

E) 0.35

F) 0.30

G) 0.10

H) 0.55

I) 0.20

J) 0.50

So, none of them is 0.8. Therefore, I must have made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the problem is not about the vapor pressure of the solution, but about the vapor pressure of the distillate. Wait, the distillate is the vapor that is collected. So, the vapor pressure of the distillate is 1066 mm Hg. But the distillate is a mixture of the two alcohols. So, the vapor pressure of the distillate would be the same as the vapor pressure of the vapor, which is determined by the composition of the vapor. So, if the vapor is collected, then the vapor pressure of the vapor is 1066 mm Hg. But how does that relate to the liquid?

Wait, maybe the problem is that the boiling point of the solution is 90°C, which is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the solution equals the atmospheric pressure. Therefore, the atmospheric pressure is 1066 mm Hg. Therefore, the vapor pressure of the solution is 1066 mm Hg. Therefore, the equation is correct. But solving gives x ≈ 0.8. But that's not in the options. Therefore, maybe the question is not about the vapor pressure of the solution, but about the vapor pressure of the distillate?

Wait, the problem says "the vapor pressure of the condensate collected in a cooled receiver is 1066 mm Hg at that temperature." So, the condensate is the liquid that is collected. Therefore, the vapor pressure of the condensate (the liquid) is 1066 mm Hg at 90°C. Therefore, the condensate is a liquid, and its vapor pressure is 1066 mm Hg. But the vapor pressure of a liquid is a property of the liquid. So, if the condensate is a mixture of the two alcohols, then its vapor pressure is 1066 mm Hg.
