Okay, let's see. The question is asking which statement describes a positive effect of a scientific discovery. The options are A through D.

First, I need to recall what a positive effect would be. Positive effects are the beneficial outcomes or advantages that result from a scientific discovery. So, I should look for an option that highlights something good or helpful.

Looking at option A: "It makes some people upset." That sounds negative. If a discovery upsets people, that's probably not a positive effect. So A is likely not the answer.

Option B: "It takes a long time to be useful." Hmm, this might be neutral or even negative. If it takes a long time, that could be seen as a drawback. But maybe sometimes it's necessary? Not sure. But the question is about a positive effect, so this might not be it.

Option C: "It helps explain how things work." That sounds positive. Scientific discoveries often lead to a better understanding of natural phenomena, which is a good thing. This seems like a positive effect because it increases knowledge and can lead to further advancements.

Option D: "It causes work to be more difficult." That's definitely negative. If a discovery makes work harder, that's a downside. So D is out.

So between B and C. The question is about a positive effect. Option C directly states a benefit, while B is about the time it takes. Even if a discovery takes time to be useful, the fact that it eventually becomes useful is a positive. But the statement B itself is about the time, which isn't inherently positive. The positive effect would be the usefulness, not the time taken. So C is the correct answer.

The question asks for a statement that describes a **positive effect** of a scientific discovery. Let's analyze each option:

- **A) It makes some people upset.**  
  This is a **negative** outcome, as it implies a harmful or distressing effect. Not a positive effect.

- **B) It takes a long time to be useful.**  
  While this may be a **drawback**, it doesn't describe a **positive** effect. The time delay is not inherently beneficial.

- **C) It helps explain how things work.**  
  This is a **clearly positive** effect. Scientific discoveries often lead to a deeper understanding of the world, which is a key benefit and a core goal of scientific inquiry.

- **D) It causes work to be more difficult.**  
  This is also a **negative** outcome, as it implies increased difficulty or burden.

Thus, the only option that directly describes a **positive effect** of a scientific discovery is:

Option C: "It helps people understand how things work." That sounds positive. Understanding how things work is a good thing. Scientific discoveries often lead to better understanding, which is a positive effect. This seems like a strong candidate.

Option D: "It causes work to be more difficult." That's definitely negative. If a discovery makes work harder, that's a negative effect. So D is out.

So between B and C. The question says "a positive effect," so even if B is a process, the actual effect of the discovery is the understanding. So C is the answer. B is about the
