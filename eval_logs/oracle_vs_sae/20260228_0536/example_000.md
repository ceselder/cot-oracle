<think>
Okay, let's see. There's a vessel with 20 liters of a mixture of milk and water in the ratio 3:2. So first, I need to figure out how much milk and water there is initially. The ratio is 3:2, which means for every 3 parts milk, there are 2 parts water. The total parts are 3 + 2 = 5 parts. 

So, the total volume is 20 liters. Therefore, each part is 20 divided by 5, which is 4 liters. That means the amount of milk is 3 parts times 4 liters per part, so 12 liters of milk. And water is 2 parts times 4 liters, so 8 liters of water. Let me check that: 12 + 8 = 20 liters. Yep, that adds up.

Now, the problem says that 10 liters of the mixture are removed and replaced with an equal quantity of pure milk. Then this process is repeated once more. We need to find the final ratio of milk to water.

Alright, let me break this down step by step. First, when we remove 10 liters of the mixture, since the mixture is uniform, the ratio of milk to water in the removed portion will be the same as the original ratio, right? So initially, the mixture is 12 liters milk and 8 liters water. So when we remove 10 liters, how much milk and water are we removing?

Since the ratio is 3:2, the proportion of milk in the mixture is 3/5, and water is 2/5. Therefore, removing 10 liters would remove (3/5)*10 = 6 liters of milk and (2/5)*10 = 4 liters of water. 

So after removing 10 liters, the remaining mixture has:

Milk: 12 - 6 = 6 liters

Water: 8 - 4 = 4 liters

Then we add 10 liters of pure milk. So the new amount of milk is 6 + 10 = 16 liters, and water remains 4 liters. So now the mixture is 16 liters milk and 4 liters water. Let me check the total volume: 16 + 4 = 20 liters. Correct.

Now, the process is repeated once more. So again, we remove 10 liters of the mixture and replace it with 10 liters of pure milk. Let me figure out what happens here.

First, the current mixture is 16 liters milk and 4 liters water. So the ratio is 16:4, which simplifies to 4:1. Wait, but the total volume is still 20 liters. So when we remove 10 liters of this mixture, the proportion of milk and water in the removed portion will be 4:1. Therefore, the amount of milk removed is (4/5)*10 = 8 liters, and water removed is (1/5)*10 = 2 liters.

So after removing 10 liters, the remaining mixture has:

Milk: 16 - 8 = 8 liters

Water: 4 - 2 = 2 liters

Then we add 10 liters of pure milk. So the new amount of milk is 8 + 10 = 18 liters, and water remains 2 liters. Therefore, the final mixture is 18 liters milk and 2 liters water. 

So the ratio of milk to water is 18:2, which simplifies to 9:1. Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 9:1. But let me check again because sometimes I might make a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me go through the steps again to make sure.

Original mixture: 12 milk, 8 water.

First removal: 10 liters removed. Since ratio is 3:2, milk removed is 6 liters, water 4 liters. Remaining milk: 12 - 6 = 6, water: 8 - 4 = 4. Then add 10 liters milk: milk becomes 6 + 10 = 16, water remains 4. So after first replacement, 16 milk, 4 water.

Second removal: 10 liters removed. Now the ratio is 16:4 = 4:1. So when removing 10 liters, the proportion of milk is 4/5, so milk removed is 8 liters, water removed is 2 liters. Remaining milk: 16 - 8 = 8, water: 4 - 2 = 2. Then add 10 liters milk: milk becomes 8 + 10 = 18, water remains 2. So final ratio is 18:2 = 9:1. So answer A.

But let me check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using formulas or something else, to confirm.

Alternatively, there's a formula for these types of problems where you're replacing a portion of a mixture with another substance. The formula for the amount of original substance remaining after n replacements is:

Final amount = Initial amount * (1 - (replaced volume / total volume))^n

But wait, this is for when you're replacing a portion each time. However, in this case, we are replacing with pure milk, so the amount of milk is being increased each time. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe we can model the milk concentration.

Initially, the concentration of milk is 3/5. After each replacement, the concentration changes.

First replacement: removing 10 liters, which is 1/2 of the total volume. So the remaining milk is 12 - (12*(10/20)) = 12 - 6 = 6 liters. Then adding 10 liters milk, so total milk becomes 6 + 10 = 16 liters. So concentration is 16/20 = 4/5.

Second replacement: again removing 10 liters, which is 1/2 of the total volume. The amount of milk removed is 4/5 * 10 = 8 liters. So remaining milk is 16 - 8 = 8 liters. Then adding 10 liters milk, total milk becomes 8 + 10 = 18 liters. So concentration is 18/20 = 9/10. Therefore, the ratio of milk to water is 9/10 : 1/10 = 9:1. So same result. So answer A.

But wait, the options given include A)9:1, which is the answer. However, let me check the options again. The options are:

A)9:1

B)4:2

C)5:2

D)9:2

E)9:0

So answer A is 9:1. But let me check again if I made a mistake in the second replacement.

Wait, after first replacement, the mixture is 16 milk and 4 water. So when we remove 10 liters, the amount of milk removed is (16/20)*10 = 8 liters. So remaining milk is 16 - 8 = 8 liters. Then adding 10 liters milk, so 8 + 10 = 18 liters milk. Water is 4 - (4/20)*10 = 4 - 2 = 2 liters. So yes, 18 milk and 2 water. So ratio is 18:2 = 9:1. So answer A.

But wait, the answer options have E)9:0. Which would be all milk. But that's not possible unless all water is removed. But in our calculation, there is 2 liters of water. So answer A is correct. But let me check again if there's a miscalculation.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the first step. Let me check again.

Original mixture: 20 liters, ratio 3:2. So milk is 12 liters, water 8 liters. Remove 10 liters. The amount of milk removed is 10*(3/5) = 6 liters. So remaining milk is 12 - 6 = 6 liters. Water removed is 10*(2/5) = 4 liters. Remaining water is 8 - 4 = 4 liters. Then adding 10 liters milk. So milk becomes 6 + 10 = 16 liters, water remains 4 liters. Correct.

Second time: remove 10 liters. Now, the ratio is 16:4, so 4:1. So when removing 10 liters, milk removed is 10*(4/5) = 8 liters. Water removed is 10*(1/5) = 2 liters. So remaining milk is 16 - 8 = 8 liters. Water is 4 - 2 = 2 liters. Then adding 10 liters milk: milk becomes 8 + 10 = 18 liters. Water is still 2 liters. So ratio is 18:2 = 9:1. So answer A. 

But let me check if the answer is different. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think of another approach.

Alternatively, think of the amount of water remaining after each operation, since water is being diluted each time.

Initially, there is 8 liters of water. When we remove 10 liters of the mixture, the amount of water removed is 10*(2/5) = 4 liters. So remaining water is 8 - 4 = 4 liters. Then, adding 10 liters of milk, so water remains 4 liters. 

Now, second time, removing 10 liters of the mixture. The current water is 4 liters in 20 liters. So the proportion of water is 4/20 = 1/5. Therefore, when removing 10 liters, the amount of water removed is 10*(1/5) = 2 liters. So remaining water is 4 - 2 = 2 liters. Then adding 10 liters of milk, so water remains 2 liters. Therefore, the final amount of water is 2 liters, and milk is 20 - 2 = 18 liters. So ratio is 18:2 = 9:1. Same result. So answer A.

But let me check the options again. The answer options are A)9:1, B)4:2, C)5:2, D)9:2, E)9:0. So answer A is 9:1. But why is there an option E)9:0? That would be if all water was removed, but in our case, there is 2 liters of water. So answer A is correct.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the first step? Let me check again. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the ratio after two replacements. Let me check with another method. Let me use the formula for successive replacements.

The formula for the amount of milk after n replacements is:

Milk = Initial milk * (1 - (V / T))^n

Wait, but actually, when you replace a portion each time, the formula is:

After each replacement, the amount of milk is multiplied by (1 - (V / T)), where V is the volume removed and T is the total volume. But since we are adding pure milk, the formula is:

Milk after first replacement: Initial milk * (1 - V/T) + V * 1 (since we add pure milk)

Wait, maybe it's better to think recursively.

First replacement:

Milk after first replacement = Initial milk - (Initial milk * (V / T)) + V

Which is Initial milk * (1 - V / T) + V

But in this case, V is 10 liters, T is 20 liters. So:

Milk after first replacement = 12*(1 - 10/20) + 10 = 12*(1 - 0.5) + 10 = 12*0.5 + 10 = 6 + 10 = 16 liters. Which matches our previous result.

Then, second replacement:

Milk after second replacement = 16*(1 - 10/20) + 10 = 16*(0.5) + 10 = 8 + 10 = 18 liters. So same result. Therefore, milk is 18 liters, water is 20 - 18 = 2 liters. So ratio is 18:2 = 9:1. So answer A.

Therefore, the answer should be A. But let me check if the options have that. Yes, option A is 9:1. So the answer is A.

But wait, the original problem says "the process is repeated once more", so two times? Let me check the problem again.

"A vessel contains 20 liters of a mixture of milk and water in the ratio 3:2. 10 liters of the mixture are removed and replaced with an equal quantity of pure milk. If the process is repeated once more, find the ratio of milk and water in the final mixture obtained?"

Yes, so the process is done twice. So first replacement, then second replacement. So our calculation is correct. So answer is A.

But let me check if there's a different interpretation. For example, maybe the first replacement is removing 10 liters and replacing with 10 liters of milk, then the second replacement is removing 10 liters of the new mixture and replacing with 10 liters of milk. Which is exactly what we did. So answer A.

But why is option E)9:0 there? Maybe a trick question? But no, because there is still 2 liters of water. So answer A is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the first step. Let me check once again.

Original mixture: 20 liters, 3:2. So milk is 12 liters, water 8 liters. Remove 10 liters. The amount of milk removed is 10*(3/5) = 6 liters. So remaining milk is 12 - 6 = 6 liters. Water removed is 10*(2/5) = 4 liters. Remaining water is 8 - 4 = 4 liters. Then adding 10 liters milk. So milk is 6 + 10 = 16 liters, water is 4 liters. Then second time, remove 10 liters. The ratio is 16:4, so 4:1. So milk is 4/5 of the mixture. So removing 10 liters, milk removed is 10*(4/5) = 8 liters. So remaining milk is 16 - 8 = 8 liters. Water removed is 10*(1/5) = 2 liters. Remaining water is 4 - 2 = 2 liters. Then adding 10 liters milk. So milk is 8 + 10 = 18 liters, water is 2 liters. So ratio is 18:2 = 9:1. So answer A. 

Yes, that's correct. Therefore, the answer is A.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{A}
</think>

To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the initial composition of the mixture and then track the changes after each replacement.

---

### **Step 1: Initial Composition**

The vessel contains **20 liters** of a mixture in the ratio **3:2 (milk : water)**.

- Total parts = 3 + 2 = 5
- Each part = $ \frac{20}{5} = 4 $ liters
- Milk = $ 3 \times 4 = 12 $ liters
- Water = $ 2 \times 4 = 8 $ liters

---

### **Step 2: First Replacement**

- **10 liters** of the mixture is removed.
- Since the mixture is uniform, the removed portion has the same ratio: **3:2**
- Milk removed = $ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 $ liters
- Water removed = $ \frac{2}{5} \times 10 = 4 $ liters

After removal:
- Milk = $ 12 - 6 = 6 $ liters
- Water = $ 8 - 4 = 4 $ liters

Then, **10 liters of pure milk** is added:
- Milk = $ 6 + 10 = 16 $ liters
- Water = 4 liters (unchanged)

---

### **Step 3: Second Replacement**

- Again, **10 liters** of the mixture is removed.
- The current mixture is **16 milk : 4 water = 4:1**
- Milk removed = $ \frac{4}{5} \times 10 = 8 $ liters
- Water removed = $ \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 $ liters

After removal:
- Milk = $ 16 - 8 = 8 $ liters
- Water = $ 4 - 2 = 2 $ liters

Then, **10 liters of pure milk** is added:
- Milk = $ 8 + 10 = 18 $ liters
- Water = 2 liters (unchanged)

---

### **Final Composition**

- Milk = 18 liters
- Water = 2 liters

Thus, the **final ratio of milk to water** is:

$$
\frac{18}{2} = 9:1
$$

---

### **Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{A}

Okay, let's see. There's this problem about a vessel containing 20 liters of a mixture of milk and water in the ratio 3:2. Then 10 liters of the mixture are removed and replaced with an equal quantity of pure milk. If the process is repeated once more, we need to find the ratio of milk and water in the final mixture. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, the initial mixture is 20 liters with milk to water ratio 3:2. So, I should figure out how much milk and water there is initially. Since the ratio is 3:2, that means for every 5 parts of the mixture, 3 are milk and 2 are water. So, total parts = 3 + 2 = 5. Therefore, milk is (3/5)*20 liters, and water is (2/5)*20 liters. Let me calculate that.

Milk initially: (3/5)*20 = 12 liters. Water initially: (2/5)*20 = 8 liters. So, the vessel starts with 12 liters milk and 8 liters water.

Now, the first step is removing 10 liters of the mixture and replacing it with pure milk. Since the mixture is uniform, removing 10 liters would remove both milk and water in the same ratio as the original mixture. So, the ratio of milk to water
