Let me think about the implications. \n\nFirst, Fargate tasks are typically associated with a single container. If you have multiple services, each might need their own container. But if they're all in one task, that could lead to resource contention. For example, if one service uses a lot of CPU, it might affect others. Also, networking could be an issue. Each service might need different ports or networking configuratio",
