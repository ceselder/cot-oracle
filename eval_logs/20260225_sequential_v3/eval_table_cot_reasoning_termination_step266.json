The wording is \"shoot one of the birds,\" which could be interpreted as removing it from the tree. But in reality, shooting a bird would likely result in it falling. However, maybe the question is a trick question. Sometimes these riddles play on the idea that the bird is shot, so it's no longer on the tree. But then",
