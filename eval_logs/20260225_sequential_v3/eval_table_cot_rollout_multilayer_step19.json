The question is asking which figure of speech is used in the sentence: \"Mona, I've told you a million times: you need to dry the dishes before you put them away.\" The options are hyperbole or oxymoron.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these figures of speech means. Hyperbole is an exaggerated statement or claim not meant to be taken literally. It's used for emphasis. Oxymoron, on the other hand, is a figure of speech in which two contradictory or opposing terms are used tog",
