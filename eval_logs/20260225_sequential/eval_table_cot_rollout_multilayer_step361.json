I need to figure out the pattern here.\n\nFirst, let me write down the numbers and see the differences between them. So, starting with 3. Then 14. The difference between 14 and 3 is 11. Then from 14 to 39, the difference is 25. So the differences are 11 and 25. Hmm. Let me check if there's a pattern in the differences. \n\n11 and 25... Maybe the differences themselves have a patt",
