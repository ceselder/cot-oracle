Hmm, let me recall how to approach this.\n\nFirst, since the line passes through the origin, its equation should be in the form y = mx + b, but since it goes through (0,0), the y-intercept b is 0. So the equation of line k is y = (1/3)x. Let me write that down:\n\ny = (1/3)x\n\nNow, the points (x, 1) and (10, y) lie on this line. That means if I plug in ",
