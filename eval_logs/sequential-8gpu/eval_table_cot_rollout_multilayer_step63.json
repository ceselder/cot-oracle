This principle states that if you have more items than containers, at least one container must contain more than one item.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\n- The drawer contains **10 black socks** and **10 white socks**.\n- We are to find the **minimum number of socks**",

The drawer has 6 black, 4 blue, 8 brown, and 2 red socks. The options are A) five, B) seven, C) eight, D) nine, E) two.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the classic sock problem. Usually, the question is about how many socks you need to pull out to guarantee a pair, considering the worst-case scenario. The general idea is that you have to consider the wor",

Mitochondria are present in both plant and animal cells because they're responsible for producing energy through cellular respiration. So, A is incorrect because plant cells do have mitochondria.
