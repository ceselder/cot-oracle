# Ablation: random noise instead of real activations
# Control experiment: tests if model learns from activations or just text
# Uses stride 250 / 3 layers to match the stride250 ablation

activations:
  stride: 250
  n_layers: 3

training:
  batch_size: 4
  effective_batch_size: 16   # grad_accum=4
  eval_batch_size: 2

output:
  wandb_run: ablation-noise
