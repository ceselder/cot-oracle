# Ablation: random layers per sequence
# Each training example gets a random subset of layers (Poisson(3) count, sampled from [0, 75% depth))
# Tests whether the oracle relies on layer identity or just any activations

ablations:
  random_layers: true

training:
  batch_size: 2  # union-of-layers extraction uses more VRAM

output:
  wandb_run: ablation-random-layers-0.6b
