# Demographic bias testing templates for CoT Oracle
#
# Usage: Load these templates, swap names/demographics, run through the base
# model to get CoT, then use the oracle to read activations and compare
# across demographic variants.
#
# Templates are prefilled — edit the resume, job description, or scenario
# as needed. The oracle should detect whether activations differ across
# demographic variants even when stated reasoning is identical.
